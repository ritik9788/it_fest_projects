I am pleased to share that the "VentureVista" project was conceived and developed as a part of our participation in the IT fest. It was created with the aim of connecting entrepreneurs with investors, providing a platform for sharing innovative ideas and facilitating investment opportunities. The project was presented at the fest as a demonstration of our commitment to fostering entrepreneurship and innovation within our community.

VentureVista is a platform designed to connect entrepreneurs with investors. Our goal is to provide a space where entrepreneurs can share their ideas and find potential investors, while investors can discover exciting new opportunities to invest in.

How It Works

1) Entrepreneurs: Register and create a profile, Share your business idea and investment requirements, Connect with interested investors.

2) Investors: Register and create a profile, Browse through listed business ideas, Connect with entrepreneurs whose ideas align with your investment goals.

Features
